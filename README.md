# Rotating LED Display with Wireless Control
This microcontroller project was built as a part of my university's CSE316: Microprocessors, Microcontrollers, and Embedded Systems Sessional course. 

We built a rotating device that blinks with precise intervals, to display a digital clock, an analog clock, and any text received via Bluetooth.
